## v0.1.54 (2026-05-01)

- Added `tui.exclude_projects` so projects can be hidden from the TUI browse and
  search lists while remaining accessible by UUID or file path
  ([#43](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/43))
- Added in-TUI session renaming from the conversation list, with a configurable
  rename keybinding
- Improved markdown rendering in the TUI, including preserved line breaks,
  indentation, tabs, and code block formatting
- Shortcut help overlays now stay usable in small terminals by clamping,
  centering, and scrolling when needed

## v0.1.53 (2026-04-17)

- Conversation viewer no longer jumps to unrelated content when toggling tool
  output (`t`), thinking (`T`), or timing (`i`), or when resizing the terminal —
  the viewport now stays anchored to the message you were reading

## v0.1.52 (2026-04-17)

- Mouse wheel scrolling in both the search result list and conversation viewer,
  and click-to-open on rows in the search result list (note: enabling mouse
  capture may interfere with click-drag text selection in some terminals — hold
  Shift, or Option on macOS, to bypass)
- Search results now show the selected position (e.g. current/total) so it's
  easier to tell where you are in the list
- Improved search snippet previews — the context line now prefers locations
  where query terms appear adjacent, instead of locking onto boilerplate matches
  that happen earlier in the conversation
- Fixed search ranking missing adjacent-phrase matches when the phrase was
  wrapped in markdown punctuation like `**media pipeline**`
- Added a Nix flake for installation on Nix systems

## v0.1.51 (2026-03-29)

- Improved search ranking — results now score matches by where they appear
  (title, project, summary, or message body), so exact project and title matches
  rank above incidental mentions in conversation text
- Search freshness scoring uses smooth decay instead of sharp cutoffs, giving
  more natural ranking between recent and older conversations

## v0.1.50 (2026-03-27)

- Pressing Esc now clears the search input first — a second Esc quits the app

## v0.1.49 (2026-03-24)

- Faster startup with per-project binary caching of parsed conversations — only
  changed files are re-parsed on subsequent launches
- Reduced memory usage by streaming JSONL lines instead of loading entire files
  into memory

## v0.1.48 (2026-03-24)

- Fixed search missing content in long conversations due to a 256K character
  truncation limit — all conversation text is now fully searchable
- Added Windows support — compilation and home directory resolution now work
  correctly on Windows ([#26](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/26))

## v0.1.47 (2026-03-22)

- Fixed conversations that only contain skill invocations (e.g. `/consult`,
  `/commit`) being incorrectly filtered out as empty sessions

## v0.1.46 (2026-03-21)

- Fixed the screen freezing when holding down arrow keys or j/k to scroll — the
  view now redraws smoothly during key repeat instead of jumping when the key is
  released ([#25](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/issues/25))

## v0.1.45 (2026-03-20)

- Skill invocation prompts (e.g. from `/consult`, `/commit`) are now hidden from
  search results and shown as a concise description in the conversation viewer
  instead of displaying the full expanded prompt text

## v0.1.44 (2026-03-17)

- Added support for `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable — users with custom
  Claude config directories can now use claude-history without workaround
  ([#24](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/issues/24))

## v0.1.43 (2026-03-14)

- Added `claude-history update` command for self-updating the binary directly
  from GitHub releases

## v0.1.42 (2026-03-13)

- Subagent messages are now included in J/K message navigation and single
  message copy
- Plain text mode (`--plain`) now supports pager output
- Fixed `--no-color` flag being ignored in normal (non-render) display mode
- Fixed text wrapping for CJK characters and emoji that occupy two terminal
  columns but were counted as one, causing text to overflow
- Deleting a session in the TUI (`Ctrl+X`) now removes the full session
  directory, not just the transcript file
- Fixed a potential crash when deleting a conversation while a search was
  in-flight
- Fixed conversations opened by UUID not showing project name or matching
  workspace filter
- `--fork-session` now requires `--resume` and shows an error if used alone
  instead of being silently ignored

## v0.1.41 (2026-03-13)

- Workspace filter now includes conversations from git worktrees of the same
  project, so sessions started in workmux worktrees appear alongside the main
  project's sessions
- Search result counter now shows the count relative to the current scope
  (project or global) instead of always showing the total

## v0.1.40 (2026-03-13)

- Search typing is now smoother — search runs in a background thread so
  keystrokes no longer block the UI, especially with large history
- Global view is now the default — all conversations are shown on launch instead
  of only the current workspace's sessions
  ([#21](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/21))
- Added `Tab` key to toggle between global and workspace-only view in the TUI
  ([#21](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/21))
- Added `-L`/`--local` flag to start with workspace filter active
- Deprecated `--global`/`-g` flag and `global` config option — global is now the
  default behavior

## v0.1.39 (2026-03-13)

- Added `--delete` flag to remove a session by its ID directly from the command
  line, e.g. `claude-history --delete <session-id>`
  ([#23](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/issues/23)
- Added `--version` flag to display the current version
  ([#22](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/issues/22))
- Invalid session IDs now show a clear error message instead of failing silently

## v0.1.38 (2026-03-13)

- Improved search for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) text — queries with CJK
  characters now match correctly even when words aren't separated by spaces
  ([#19](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/19))
- Added emacs-style keybindings to the search input: `Ctrl+A`/`Ctrl+E` to jump
  to start/end, `Ctrl+B`/`Ctrl+F` to move by character, `Alt+B`/`Alt+F` and
  `Ctrl+Left`/`Ctrl+Right` to move by word, `Ctrl+K` to kill to end of line,
  `Ctrl+U` to kill to start of line
  ([#19](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/19))
- Fixed cursor alignment issues with wide characters (e.g. CJK, emoji) in the
  search input and conversation viewer
  ([#19](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/19))

## v0.1.37 (2026-03-13)

- Linux prebuilt binaries are now statically linked, fixing compatibility issues
  on older distros with outdated glibc versions
  ([#20](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/issues/20))

## v0.1.36 (2026-03-12)

- Added message-level navigation — press `J`/`K` or `[`/`]` to jump between
  messages in the conversation viewer, with a teal marker showing the focused
  message ([#15](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/15))
- Added single message copy — press `y` to copy the currently selected message
  to the clipboard instead
  ([#15](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/15))
- Fixed empty thinking blocks rendering as blank "Thinking" labels with no
  content

## v0.1.35 (2026-03-12)

- Timestamps in the conversation list now automatically switch between relative
  ("just now", "5 min ago", "2 hours ago", "yesterday") for recent sessions and
  absolute ("Mar 05, 14:30") for older ones
- Recent conversations are color-graded by recency — newest sessions appear in
  bright teal, fading to gray as they get older, making it easy to spot recent
  activity at a glance
- Removed `--relative-time`/`--absolute-time` flags and `display.relative_time`
  config option — the new hybrid format replaces both

## v0.1.34 (2026-03-12)

- Search now covers tool output (command results, file contents, grep output),
  so you can find conversations by content that previously only appeared in tool
  calls
- Search highlighting now merges adjacent matches across separators — searching
  "red team" highlights the full word `red_team` instead of just the individual
  parts
- Improved search performance in conversations with large tool outputs

## v0.1.33 (2026-03-12)

- Added automatic light/dark theme detection — the TUI now adapts its color
  scheme to match your terminal background
- Fixed arrow key navigation lag when holding keys to scroll quickly through the
  list or conversation viewer
- Fixed slow redraw when pasting text into the search field

## v0.1.32 (2026-03-12)

- Fixed clipboard copy/yank not working on Linux — now uses `wl-copy` on Wayland
  and `xclip`/`xsel` on X11, with automatic display server detection
  ([#17](https://github.com/raine/claude-history/pull/17))
- Fixed resuming sessions from deleted or ephemeral git worktrees failing with
  an error instead of gracefully recovering

## v0.1.31 (2026-03-09)

- Search now matches project names, so you can find sessions by the project they
  belong to

## v0.1.30 (2026-03-09)

- Preview panel now shows the last messages by default instead of the first, so
  you see the most recent context at a glance (use `--first` to revert)

## v0.1.29 (2026-03-09)

- Added `--fork-session` flag to resume a conversation as a fork, creating a new
  branch from an existing session
- Cross-project forking: when forking a session from a different project, the
  session files are automatically copied to the current project so Claude
  resumes in the right context
- Added configurable keybindings via the `[keys]` section in the config file,
  allowing rebinding of resume (`Ctrl+R`), fork (`Ctrl+F`), and delete
  (`Ctrl+X`) actions
- Session list search now matches session UUIDs, making it easier to find a
  specific conversation by ID
- Fixed markdown rendering issues: soft breaks no longer collapse words
  together, inline code no longer clips at block edges, and list item spacing is
  correct

## v0.1.28 (2026-03-04)

- Subagent (Task tool) messages are now nested under their parent task, keeping
  the conversation view clean and organized with `↳` prefixed entries
- Subagent internals are hidden by default and revealed with `T` or
  `--show-thinking`, same as thinking blocks
- XML-tagged content (system reminders, analysis blocks) now displays correctly
  instead of being silently stripped
- Conversations from CI or headless Claude runs that lack timestamps now parse
  and display correctly

## v0.1.27 (2026-02-26)

- Session titles (set via `/rename` in Claude Code) now appear in the
  conversation list and viewer, making it easier to find named sessions
- Search preview shows matches better now

## v0.1.26 (2026-02-18)

- Added `global = true` config option to default to global search without
  passing `-g` every time, with `--local` flag to override when needed
- Ledger export and clipboard copy now render markdown properly (headings,
  lists, code blocks, tables) and wrap long lines instead of overflowing
- Fixed high idle CPU usage (~9% down to near zero) when the TUI was sitting
  idle after loading
- Fixed search preview highlighting partial word matches instead of the actual
  search phrase
- Fixed long lines in code blocks overflowing the terminal width
- Fixed blank lines and indentation issues in ledger export

## v0.1.25 (2026-02-11)

- Added `--show-id` (`-i`) flag to print the selected conversation's session ID,
  useful for resuming with custom shell aliases (e.g.,
  `claude --resume $(claude-history --show-id)`)
- Added `I` keybinding in the viewer to copy the session ID to clipboard

## v0.1.24 (2026-02-11)

- Tool calls now default to **truncated** mode, showing the header and first few
  lines with a "(N more lines...)" indicator — a middle ground between hidden
  and full output. Press `t` to cycle through modes: off, truncated, full
- Added `--no-tools` flag to start with tools hidden (complements `--show-tools`
  for full mode)
- Tables in conversation output are now rendered with proper box-drawing borders
  instead of being collapsed into plain text

## v0.1.23 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed blank or empty message blocks occasionally appearing in conversation
  output

## v0.1.22 (2026-02-07)
