`claude-history` is a companion CLI for Claude Code. It lets you search recent
conversations recorded in Claude's local project history with a built-in
terminal UI, then view the selected transcript directly in the terminal with
scrolling, search, and export capabilities.

Run it from the project directory you work on with Claude Code and it will
discover the matching transcript folder automatically.

> [!TIP]
> **New:** experimental semantic search is now available. See
> [Semantic search](#semantic-search) for details.
>
> **New:** use the companion Claude Code skill to let agents search your Claude
> history with the bounded `agent` protocol. See [Agent protocol](#agent-protocol)
> for the CLI workflow and skill path.

## Install

### Quick install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raine/claude-history/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```sh
brew install raine/claude-history/claude-history
```

### Cargo

```sh
cargo install claude-history
```

## Updating

```sh
claude-history update
```

Homebrew users should use `brew upgrade claude-history` instead.

## Usage

Run the tool from inside the project directory you're interested in:

```sh
$ claude-history
```

This opens a terminal UI listing all conversations, sorted by recency. Type to
search across all transcripts. Each item shows a preview of the conversation.
Quoted exact matches also show hidden context when the match is not visible in
the preview.

### Message navigation

Press `J`/`K` or `[`/`]` to enter message navigation mode. A teal `▌` marker
appears in the gutter showing which message is focused. While in this mode:

- `J` / `]` — jump to next message
- `K` / `[` — jump to previous message
- `y` — copy the focused message to clipboard (raw markdown)
- `Esc` — exit message navigation mode

Searching with `/` also activates message navigation, focusing the message
containing each match as you move through results with `n`/`N`. The status bar
shows the current match number and total matches while search is active.

### Search

Unquoted search matches words flexibly:

- `config` matches `CONFIG`
- `api key` matches `API_KEY`
- `auth` matches `authentication` and `authorize`
- `red` won't match inside `fired`
- multiple words must all match

Identifier-style terms with underscores keep the underscore, so `api_key` matches
`api_key` but not `api key`.

Use quotes when you need exact text. For example, `"DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN"` matches
`DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` but not `deployment token`. Lowercase quoted text ignores
case, while quoted text with uppercase letters is case-sensitive.

You can mix both styles: `metrics "DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN"` searches for `metrics` as
usual, but only returns conversations that also contain `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN`.

Search also includes tool results, not just user and assistant messages. Paste a
full session UUID to jump directly to that session. Quote the UUID to search for
it as transcript text instead.

Results are ranked by relevance using field-aware scoring: matches in the
title, project name, and summary are weighted higher than body text. Within
equally relevant results, recent conversations rank first.

### Semantic search

Semantic search ranks conversations by meaning instead of exact word matches. It
embeds recent conversation chunks locally, combines semantic similarity with
lexical signals, and shows the best matching evidence preview for each result.
The first semantic search may download the local model and generate embeddings,
which can take a while for large histories.

Quoted text works in semantic mode too. For example,
`deployment "DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN"` finds conversations where the matching visible
semantic evidence also contains the exact identifier. A quoted-only semantic
search, such as `"DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN"`, returns exact matches newest-first.

Press `Ctrl+T` in the conversation list to switch between lexical and semantic
search. To start in semantic mode by default, set:

```toml
[search]
mode = "semantic"
```

The older `[tui] semantic_search = true` setting is still accepted for existing
configs.

### Direct file input

You can open a JSONL conversation file directly, bypassing the conversation
selection UI:

```sh
$ claude-history /path/to/conversation.jsonl
```

All display options work in this mode:

```sh
$ claude-history --show-tools --show-thinking /path/to/conversation.jsonl
```

Press `q` or `Esc` to quit when viewing a file directly.

### Conversation viewer

Press `Enter` on a conversation to open the built-in viewer. The viewer displays
conversations in a ledger-style format with scrolling support.

**Features:**

- **Scrolling**: Navigate with vim-style keys (`j`/`k`), arrow keys, or the
  mouse wheel
- **Search**: Press `/` to search within the conversation, then `n`/`N` to
  navigate matches
- **Cycle tools**: Press `t` to cycle tool display (summary → truncated → full)
- **Toggle thinking**: Press `T` to show/hide thinking blocks
- **Show path**: Press `p` to display the conversation file path
- **Light/dark theme**: Automatically detects terminal background color and
  applies an appropriate color theme

Press `q` or `Esc` to return to the conversation list.

### Agent protocol

Use `claude-history agent` when you want Claude Code to look up something from
your past Claude conversations. It gives agents a search-and-read workflow: find
the right conversation, narrow to the relevant section, then read only the few
messages needed as evidence.

The companion Claude Code skill at `skills/claude-history-search/SKILL.md` tells
agents how to use this workflow without pasting whole transcripts into context.

The usual flow is:

```sh
$ claude-history agent search --hybrid "deployment rollback decision" --top 5
$ claude-history agent within ch_1234abcd5678 --lexical "rollback"
$ claude-history agent read ch_1234abcd5678:m7..m9 --focus m8..m8
```

Use semantic or hybrid search when you remember the topic but not the exact
wording. Use lexical or exact search for identifiers, filenames, commands, error
messages, and stack traces.

Search is global by default. Add `--local` to search only the current workspace.
Results are grouped by conversation and include copyable `read ref=... focus=...`
lines for the next command. Reads are budgeted by default so agents get the
relevant excerpt instead of an entire transcript.

Useful options:

- `--top 10` controls how many conversations global search returns.
- `--hits-per-conv 2` controls how much evidence appears per conversation.
- `--tools`, `--tool-results`, `--thinking`, and `--subagents` include content
  hidden from reads by default.
- `--no-budget` disables read truncation when you intentionally want unbounded
  output.

### Preview modes

- `claude-history` shows the last messages in the preview (default)
- `claude-history --first` flips the preview to the first messages

### Showing tool calls

In the TUI viewer, tool calls default to **summary** mode — showing condensed
activity like "Searched for 2 patterns, read 1 file" without tool inputs or
outputs. Press `t` to cycle through modes: summary → truncated → full. Truncated
mode shows the tool header plus the first few body lines with a "(N more
lines...)" indicator. Click a truncated tool call/result to expand that specific
output, and click it again to collapse it. Use `--show-tools` (or `-t`) to start
in full mode, or `--no-tools` to start in summary mode.

### Showing thinking blocks and subagent messages

Extended thinking models (like Claude Sonnet 4.5) include reasoning steps in
their output. When Claude uses the Task tool to spawn subagents, the internal
tool calls and messages within those subagents are also hidden by default. Use
`--show-thinking` (or press `T` in the TUI) to display both thinking blocks and
subagent internals. Subagent messages appear dimmed with a `↳` prefix to
distinguish them from top-level conversation entries.

### Resuming conversations

If you want to continue a conversation, launch `claude-history` with `--resume`
and it will hand off to `claude --resume <conversation-id>`.

To fork a conversation (creating a new session branching from the original), use
`--resume --fork-session` or press `Ctrl+F` in the TUI.

Within the same project, this passes `--fork-session` to `claude`, which creates
a new session ID branching from the original. When forking a conversation from a
different project, the session files are copied to your CWD's project directory
and resumed there — the copy continues independently without affecting the
original.

You can configure default arguments to pass to the `claude` command every time
you resume a conversation. This is useful if you typically run Claude with
specific flags (like `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) and want them applied
automatically when resuming:

```toml
# ~/.config/claude-history/config.toml
[resume]
default_args = ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
```

With this configuration, when you resume a conversation, it will run:

```sh
claude --resume <conversation-id> --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This provides a cleaner alternative to shell aliases, as the arguments are
applied specifically when resuming through `claude-history`, without affecting
how you normally invoke Claude.

If you use a shell alias for `claude` with extra flags, you can use `--show-id`
to select a session and resume it manually:

```sh
claude --resume $(claude-history --show-id)
```

In the viewer, press `I` to copy the session ID to clipboard.

### Markdown rendering

Claude's responses are rendered with markdown formatting for better terminal
readability. Use `--plain` to disable rendering and get raw text output.

### Plain output mode

Use `--plain` to output conversations without ledger formatting:

```sh
$ claude-history --plain
```

This produces simple `Role: content` output without colors, text wrapping, or
markdown rendering, suitable for piping to other tools or LLMs:

```
You: How do I fix this bug?

Claude: Looking at the code, the issue is...
```

### Pager output

By default, conversation output is piped through a pager (`less -R`) when stdout
is a terminal. This enables scrolling through long conversations. Use
`--no-pager` to disable this behavior and print directly to stdout.

The pager respects the `$PAGER` environment variable. If not set, it defaults to
`less -R` (which preserves ANSI colors).

### Scope: all conversations vs current workspace

By default, `claude-history` shows all conversations from every project, sorted
by modification time (newest first). Each conversation shows its project path so
you can identify which project it belongs to.

Press `Tab` to toggle between all conversations and the current workspace only.
Use `-L`/`--local` to start with the workspace filter active.

For [workmux](https://github.com/raine/workmux) users, worktree paths are
displayed in a compact format: `[project/worktree]` instead of just the worktree
folder name. The project filter (toggled with `Tab`) is worktree-aware: it
includes conversations from the main repo and all its worktrees, regardless of
which one you're currently in.

The `--resume` flag works across projects. It will automatically run Claude in
the correct project directory for the selected conversation.

### Integration with other scripts

You can integrate `claude-history` into other tools to pass conversation context
to new Claude Code sessions. This is useful when you want Claude to understand
what you were working on previously.

For example, a commit message generator script could use the conversation
history to write more contextual commit messages:

```bash
# Get conversation history if --context flag is set
conversation_context=""
if [ "$include_history" = true ]; then
    echo "Loading conversation history..."
    conversation_history=$(claude-history --plain 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$conversation_history" ]; then
        conversation_context="

=== START CONVERSATION CONTEXT ===
$conversation_history
=== END CONVERSATION CONTEXT ===

"
    fi
fi

# Pass to Claude CLI with the conversation context
prompt="Write a commit message for these changes.
${conversation_context}
Staged changes:
$staged_diff"

claude -p "$prompt"
```

## Configuration

You can set default preferences for display options in
`~/.config/claude-history/config.toml`. Command-line flags will override these
settings.

Create the config file:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-history
cat > ~/.config/claude-history/config.toml << 'EOF'
[display]
# Tool display: true = summary, false = full (default: unset = summary)
# no_tools = false

# Show last messages in TUI preview (default: true)
# last = true

# Show thinking blocks (default: false)
show_thinking = false

# Use plain output without ledger formatting (default: false)
plain = false

# Use pager for output (default: true when stdout is a terminal)
pager = true

[resume]
# Default arguments to pass to claude command when resuming
# Example: default_args = ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]

[keys]
# Customize keybindings (default: ctrl+r, ctrl+f, f2, ctrl+x)
# Supports ctrl+<key>, alt+<key>, single-character keys, and f1-f12
# rename = "alt+r"
# fork = "alt+f"

[search]
# Search mode: lexical, semantic, exact, or hybrid
mode = "lexical"

[tui]
# Hide exact project names from TUI browse/search lists
# exclude_projects = ["project-name", "repo/worktree"]

# Deprecated: use [search].mode instead
semantic_search = false

EOF
```

### Available options

#### Display options

- `no_tools` (boolean): When `true` or unset (default), shows tool summaries;
  when `false`, shows full tool details
- `last` (boolean): Show last messages instead of first in TUI preview (default:
  true)
- `show_thinking` (boolean): Show thinking blocks and subagent internals in
  conversation output (default: false)
- `plain` (boolean): Output plain text without ledger formatting (default:
  false)
- `pager` (boolean): Pipe output through a pager for scrolling (default: true
  when stdout is a terminal)

#### Resume options

- `default_args` (array of strings): Arguments to pass to the `claude` command
  when resuming conversations. Useful for flags like
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` that you want applied every time you resume.
  Example: `default_args = ["--dangerously-skip-permissions", "--verbose"]`

#### Key bindings

Customize the keybindings for resume, fork, rename, and delete actions. Values
are key combinations like `"ctrl+r"`, `"alt+f"`, or `"f2"`.

- `resume` (string): Resume conversation (default: `"ctrl+r"`)
- `fork` (string): Fork and resume conversation (default: `"ctrl+f"`)
- `rename` (string): Rename selected session (default: `"f2"`)
- `delete` (string): Delete conversation (default: `"ctrl+x"`)

#### Search options

- `mode` (string): Search mode to use by default. Supported values are
  `lexical`, `semantic`, `exact`, and `hybrid` (default: `lexical`). The TUI
  supports lexical and semantic modes; exact and hybrid defaults start the TUI in
  lexical mode.

#### TUI options

- `exclude_projects` (array of strings): Case-sensitive project names to hide
  from TUI browse/search lists. Match against the project name shown in the
  leftmost column; a parent entry like `"repo"` also hides displayed worktree
  rows like `"repo/feature"`. Excluded conversations remain on disk and can
  still be opened by pasting their full UUID or by passing the JSONL file path
  directly.
- `semantic_search` (boolean): Deprecated compatibility alias. When
  `[search].mode` is unset, `true` starts list search in semantic mode and
  `false` starts lexical mode. Press `Ctrl+T` in the TUI to switch modes.

### Overriding config

Each display option has opposing flags for explicit override:

- `--no-tools` / `--show-tools`
- `--last` / `--first`
- `--hide-thinking` / `--show-thinking`
- `--plain` (no opposite flag)
- `--no-pager` / `--pager`

For example, if your config has `no_tools = false` (showing full tool details),
you can temporarily switch to summaries with `--no-tools`.

## Custom Claude config directory

If you use the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to store Claude's
configuration in a non-default location, `claude-history` will respect it
automatically — no extra flags needed.

## Filtering details

The tool filters out some noisy artifacts before showing conversations, so you
only see transcripts that are likely to matter for your recent work.

- Skips the "Warmup / I'm Claude Code…" exchanges that are sometimes injected
  without user interaction
- Skips conversations that only contain the `/clear` terminal command

## Development

The repository includes `just` recipes:

```sh
$ just check
```

This runs `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --fix`, `cargo test`, and `cargo build`.
GitHub Actions also verifies the Nix build on pull requests, main, and release
tags.
